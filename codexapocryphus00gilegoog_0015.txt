This volume contains all the uncanonical'Gospels
which the editor Dr Thilo could procui-e, either from
printed editions or manuscripts: and it was his
intention to publish in two other volumes all the
uncanonical Acts and Epistles in like manner. Twenty
years, however, have now passed and the labeum of
Dr Thilo still remain suspended—never, in au prob&
bility, to be reeumed. Meanwhile the previous edi-
tions of sepasaoe portione, end also Thilo's own volumen
have become scarae, in addition w their incomplere-
neSS, ancl it has, sor a long time been impossible for a
student οἱ the present day, except at ει very great
outlay of money and trouble, to form a complete
collection οἱ these apocrypha] Writings. To remedy
this evil, and to enable the student to have in his own
library all that has yet been gathered of these ancient
records, the present volume is now published, with no
protensione to originality of matter, but only of com-
plebeness in its contents;—and even this is to be
understood with reference to those works only which
have appeared in preceding edifions, and not to such
wn'tings of the kind as still exist in manuscript only.
