Fabriciani, ab Andr-n Barcha, episcopo Arduum,
Ham, 1804.

Thia work contains several tracis not given in the
Codex, but the text is eo inaceurete that the volume
was thereby rendered comparatively useless.

The same year produced also another work profess-
ing by its title-page to be more complere tliun my of
the preceding—Cotym mium veterum apocryphorum

In 1823 a specimen of a new and more complete
edition οἱ the Apocryphal Writings of the New Tes-

containing an unpublished work on the Acts οἱ Saint
Thomas,and bearing this title:

Nine years however passed away before the learned
editor resumed his labours; and atlast in 1832 he
published the first volume οἱ a collection which was
intended to compr-ise every thing that was found in
preceding editions and also ⁸11 works hitherto lying
inedited in the principa} public librar-ies of Europe.
The title οἱ this volume ie ns follows:
